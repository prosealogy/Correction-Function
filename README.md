## Description
Assisted in adding correction functionality to the ‘MangaChat,’ a web design project spanning both teacher and student interfaces. Conducted two rounds of testing iterations using prototype demos. <br>
More details can be found in the Case Study link below.

## Prototype
I created the prototype that went through the entire correction process from teachers to students. While using the prototype on Figma, pressing 'z' adjusts the screen size, and clicking on the hotspots allows navigation through the prototype.
